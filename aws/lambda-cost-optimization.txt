Lambda cost-optimization

1. Right-sizing
	AWS Lambda power tuning: https://github.com/alexcasalboni/aws-lambda-power-tuning
	This is a tool for finding the most cost-optimal configuration of a Lambda function.
	This deployed a Step function state machine in the account.
	We can specify the memory configurations for which to test the function.
	This tool then creates multiple copies of our target lambda function to test and then checks the function duration on each copy of the function.

2. Don't use idle wait time in Lambda
	- use step functions for orchestration.
	
3. Use direct integrations wherever possible - instead of making a Lambda do it.
