To mount a volume to an ec2 instance (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-using-volumes.html):

1. lsblk
	- this lists all the storage devices attached to the instance.
	- there should be a storage device named 'xvda'; which is the root volume.
	- and then there should also be the volume we just attached. (possibly xvdf - could be anything in xvd[f to p])

2. The prefix /dev/ must be missing when you do the lsblk command. Make sure to specify the full name: /dev/xvdf

3. sudo file -s /dev/xvdf

	- If its a fresh new volume that we attached, it will have no file system and on executing the above command,
	  it will just show 'data'.
	
	- If it was restored from a snapshot, then it will have a Filesystem.

	- ONLY if its a fresh new volume, we need to format it and create a filesystem.

4. sudo mkfs -t xfs /dev/xvdf

	- This will format the volume using the xfs file system (I think?).
	- If you get an error that mkfs.xfs is not found, 
	  use the following command to install the XFS tools and then repeat the previous command:

		sudo yum install xfsprogs

5. Now make a directory where you want this volume to be mounted at. So, 
	
	sudo mkdir /data

6. ...AND mount it.

	sudo mount /dev/xvdf /data


Now, even though have properly mounted the volume, after reboot, this will be lost. So, to make it persistent, here's what
we do:

1. Add an entry for this new volume in the /etc/fstab file.
   Before editing the file, first create a copy of it:

	sudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.orig

2. sudo blkid

	- This will give us the UUID of the devices.
	  Copy this UUID.

  (For Ubuntu 18.04 use the lsblk command:	sudo lbslk -o +UUID	)

3. Open the /etc/fstab file and add the following line:

	UUID=aebf131c-6957-451e-8d34-ec978d9581ae  /data  xfs  defaults,nofail  0  2

	/data -> the directory where we're mounting the device.

4. IMPORTANT: If there is something wrong in the /etc/fstab file after us editing it, the instance won't be able to reboot.
 	      So, it's crucial to make sure that the file is correct.

	We can do that by manually unmounting the volume and executing a command to mount all volumes.

	sudo umount /data
	sudo mount -a

	if this command executes without any errors, then VOILA ! You've done it.
