important points regarding buildspec file

- By default CodeBuild expects a file named buildspec.yml at the root of the source.
- We can however change this to a name and location as desired.
- There are three ways of doing this :
	1. Using aws cli - create project or update-project command : setting buildspec value to the path we choose.
	2. Using aws cli - start-build command & we set the buildspecOverride value to the path where we have our file.
	3. Using CloudFormation - set the BuildSpec property of Source in a resource of type AWS::CodeBuild::Project.
