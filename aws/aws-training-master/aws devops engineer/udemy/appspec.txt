CodeDeploy - appspec file

The file naming convention depends on compute platform :

ECS : 
- appspec.yaml
- contains ARN of the TaskDefinition which to use
- the container and port in your replacement task set where your application LB or n/w LB reroutes traffic during a deployment. (given in the LoadBalancerInfo instruction)

Lambda : 
- appspec.yaml. 
- which lambda function version to deploy.
- which lambda functions to use as validation tests.
- Can be YAML or JSON-formatted
