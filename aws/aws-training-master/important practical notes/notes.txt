1. VPC & Load balancers:

  When creating an internet facing load balancers and putting private instances behind this load balancer:
	- make sure there is a public subnet in the same availability zone as that of the instance in the private subnet.
	- Since load balancers need to have internet access, while selecting subnets for each availability zone - we can 
	  select this public subnet within each availability zone.
	- Hence, the load balancer can communicate with the private instance(s).
