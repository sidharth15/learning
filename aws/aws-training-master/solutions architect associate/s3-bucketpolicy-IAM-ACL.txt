Difference between S3 bucket policies,IAM policies and Access Control Lists

S3 bucket policies :

 - attached to S3 buckets

 - just applicable for S3 buckets and its contents

 - consists of 'principal'element
 - which specifies the list of principals(users/roles/groups) to whom the statement
 is applicable.


   For eg :

		{

 		 "Version": "2012-10-17",

		  "Statement": [

		    {

		      "Effect": "Allow",

		      "Principal": {

		        "AWS": ["arn:aws:iam::111122223333:user/Alice",

                	"arn:aws:iam::111122223333:root"]

		       },

		      "Action": "s3:*",

		      "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::my_bucket",

		                   "arn:aws:s3:::my_bucket/*"]

		    }

		  ]

		}


IAM policies :

 - attached to IAM users/groups/roles.

 - applicable to any aws resources.

 - doesnt have a 'principal' element because whoever the policy is attached to IS the principal.


   For eg :

{
  
"Version": "2012-10-17",

  "Statement":[
{
    "Effect": "Allow",

    "Action": "s3:*",

    "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::my_bucket",

                 "arn:aws:s3:::my_bucket/*"]

    }

  ]
}




S3 ACLs:

 - its a legacy access control mechanism

 - it is applied to every S3 bucket and object.



How does authorization work when multiple access control mechanisms are used?


Whenever a principal issues a request to S3, the authorization depends on 
the UNION of all IAM policies, 
bucket policies and S3 ACLs that apply.


In accordance with the principle of least-privilege, 
decisions default to DENY and an explicit DENY 
always trumps an ALLOW. 


For example, if an IAM policy grants access to an object, the S3 bucket policies denies access to that 
object, 
and there is no S3 ACL, then access will be denied. 
Similarly, if no method specifies an ALLOW, then the request 
will be denied by default. 
Only if no method specifies a DENY and one or more methods specify an ALLOW will the 
request be allowed.



An operation to an S3 object ----> Default decision = deny ----> Evaluate all applicable policies --->
 
			   NO				      NO
is there an explicit deny ----> else is there explicit allow ----> Default deny
|				   |
	  
| YES				   | YES
	  
|				   |
	  
V				   V
	
Deny				 Allow
