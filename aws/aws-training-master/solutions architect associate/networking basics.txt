networking basics:

ipv4 - 32 bits
ipv6 - 128 bits

ipv4 addresses :
binary - 
0000 0000 : 0000 0000 : 0000 0000 : 0000 0000

each of the groups of zeroes separated by : is called octets.

classes of ip addresses :
class A - binary address starting with 0-
class B - binary address starting with 10-
class C - binary address starting with 110-
class D - binary address starting with 1110-
class E - binary address starting with 1111-

identifying networking portions and host portion :

class A : uses the remainder of the first octet to identify network & the rest 
	  to identify host.
class B : uses the remainder of first octet + second octet for network portion.
class C : uses the remainder of first octet + second + third octet


subnet mask : how many bits to look for getting the network portion.
	     (whats given above itself)
how many 1's in subnet mask --> tells which bits are to be looked up for getting
				network portion

do bitwise AND between ipv4 address and the subnet mask to get the network portion 
of the address.
the remaining would be the host portion.


to create further subnets, add a 1 to the subnet mask.
so 1111 1111 1111 0000 is changed to 1111 1111 1111 1000

so doing bitwise AND will give us 192.168.0.128

so the subnet here is 192.168.0.128

and the first subnetwork is from 192.168.0.1 (cant use 0 and 255 i think)
			     to  192.168.0.127

and the second subnetwork is from 192.168.0.129
			      to  192.168.0.255

NOTE : The subnet itself is not used as the ipv4 address.

CIDR : Classless Inter Domain Routing

what CIDR does is, with the ip address itself, we can give how many bits of the ip
address represents the network portion .
so for 192.168.0.15/24,
			the first 24 bits of the ip address given are considered 
			significant for the network routing.

so previously we couldn't combine addresses from network 192.168.0.0 and 192.168.1.0
since the netmask for class C was 255.255.255.0
but with CIDR we can give 23,
